/*
 *  A frog has to cross a road to meet its beloved she-frog at the other end.
The road however has cars coming and can crush the frog.
Road is 10 lanes wide.
Devise an algorithm to help the frog carry on its family.
The time a car will cross the path of the frog is given in an Array of Vectors (One vector for each lane).
And each lane-vector has minutes corresponding to the cars that are running on that lane.
Example:
Lane1 : 1, 5, 9, 10
Lane2: 5
Lane3: 3, 7
â€¦. etc.
So, the above means that in Lane1, there are 4 cars and they will cross 
 * the path frog is trying to cross at 1, 5, 9 and 10 minutes respectively.
 * 
 * Assume the frog has 3 commands at its disposal: Jump_Fwd, Jump_Bck, Wait.
